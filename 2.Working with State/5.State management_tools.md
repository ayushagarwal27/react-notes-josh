# State Management Tools
The mental model I use when figuring out which tool to use:

1.  If it's a static website, like my blog, I use React alone (with the help of context)
    
2.  If it's a client-heavy application like my Beat Saber level editor, I use Redux for global state.
    
3.  If it's a server-heavy application like this course platform, I use React + something to help with the network stuff. I'm using Vercel's  [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/)  on this course platform and I have no complaints.

This is the formula I've found works best, after years of experience and dozens of projects, but a lot of this really does come down to subjective preference.

I plan on continuing to use "Classic" Redux, without Redux Toolkit.
