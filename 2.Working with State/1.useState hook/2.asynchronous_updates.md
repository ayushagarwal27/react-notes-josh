# Asynchronous Updates

 - **state setters aren't immediate.**
```jsx
        <button
            onClick={()  =>  {
              setCount(count +  1);
      
              console.log(count)
            }} >
          Click me!
	     </button>
```
- output = 0
 - When we call `setCount`, we tell React that we'd like to request a change to a state variable. React doesn't immediately drop everything; it waits until the current operation is completed (processing the click), and then it updates the value and triggers a re-render
 - Important thing to know is that **updating a state variable is asynchronous.** It affects what the state will be _for the next render_. It's a scheduled update.
```jsx
       <button
	       onClick={()  =>  {
		       const nextCount = count +  1;
		       setCount(nextCount);
		       
		       console.log(nextCount)
		       }}>
		    Click me!
	    </button>
```
- output = 1
- We store the updated value in a variable, so that we can access that variable whenever we want to know what the new value is.

- I like to use the prefix  `next`, since it conveys that we're talking about the "future" value of the state, what it will be on the next render. But you can name this variable whatever you like.
