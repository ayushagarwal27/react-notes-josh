# Props Vs. State

## Props

- “Props” is short for “properties”. At a micro level, they're like the attributes we place on HTML elements, like  `class`  or  `href`
- Props allow us to customize the behaviour of a given component, so that the exact same component can do different things in different scenarios.

- **Props are the inputs to our components**, like arguments passed to a function.
- a way by which parent components communicates with children components.
  

## State
- But what if we wanted stuff to change over time? That's where state comes in.

props: **are the tunnels that allow data to flow through our application.**
