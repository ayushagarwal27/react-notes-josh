# Error Boundaries

- Single `ErrorBoundary` component per codebase, and reuse this component whenever I need a new error boundary. And so we won't need to actually work with class components at all, once we've set this up.

- This handy component can be used to "wall off" different sections of our application, guaranteeing that problems in one section don't affect the other. As a result, small problems in our code don't cause _big_ problems for our users!

## Error tracking

Error boundaries allow us to soften the blow of an unexpected code failure, but what if we wanted to be notified about them, so that we can fix the problem altogether for future users?

Error trackers like  [Sentry](https://sentry.io/)  and  [LogRocket](https://logrocket.com/)  can help us catalog these unexpected issues. They'll let us see how often the issues are occurring, and provide a bunch of metadata to help us understand and fix the problem.

The Sentry SDK even has an  [ErrorBoundary component](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/react/features/error-boundary/). It's quite a bit like the one we saw in this lesson, but it also collects data about the failure for us.
