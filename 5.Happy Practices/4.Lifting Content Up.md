# Lifting Content Up

```jsx
function  ArticlePage({ articleSlug })  {
  return  (
    <>
        <Header  />
      {/*
      Move <Article> so that it's a child of
      the <MainContent> element:
      */}
        <MainContent>
            <Article  articleSlug={articleSlug}  />
        </MainContent>
        <footer>
          Copyright “The News” Inc.
        </footer>
    </>
  );
}
```
- By structuring things in this way, we've preserved the exact same DOM structure as we had initially, but we've changed the _React_ structure so that `<Article>` is being created by the `ArticlePage` component.
- Part of the issue is that we often think in terms of  _parents_  and  _children_. That's how we think about DOM nodes. But there's  _another_  important relationship when it comes to React:  **owners**  and  **ownees**.

- This is a fundamental concept; we see this relationship  [all over](https://github.com/facebook/react/search?q=owner)  the React codebase.

- When a React element is created within a component, we say that the component “owns” that element. It decides what the props should be.

- And so, this restructure hasn't changed the parent/child relationship in terms of the DOM, but it  _has_  changed which component owns the  `<Article>`  element! By lifting the element up so that it's owned by  `ArticlePage`, we're changing which component is responsible for setting its props, and neatly solving the problem at hand.

**Do all elements have an owner?**

- `root.render`: `<div>`  doesn't have an owner, because it isn't being rendered within a component.

- But yeah, in practice, virtually all of the JSX we write will be owned by some component.
