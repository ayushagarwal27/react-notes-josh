# Portals

- Normally, React elements are turned into DOM nodes in a symmetrical fashion,  portals allow us to "teleport" the output DOM nodes to a target container.

Here's the syntax, for easy reference:
```jsx
import  { createPortal }  from  'react-dom';

function Modal({ children })  {
  return createPortal(
      // The React elements to render:
    <div  className="modal">
    {children}
    </div>,
      // The target DOM container to hold the output:
      document.querySelector('#modal-root')
    );
}
```
You'll also need to edit the HTML file to create that target container:
```html
<div  id="modal-root"></div>
```
- `createPortal` function creates a description that React uses in the render process, to let the renderer know that this slice of the app needs to be injected into a different container.
