# Deriving State

-  100 milliseconds is the generally-accepted threshold for how much time has to pass for it to be noticeable. If the user submits their guess, and the result is shown in 50ms, or 75ms, or 90ms, it feels more-or-less instantaneous. if it takes 110ms, that will feel like a very short delay.
  
-  State being a “pure” representation of the data. Where the state is in a much more complicated shape, the updates become much more challenging.

- If we store the minimum representation in state, we can change the state much more easily. As a general rule, our life becomes much easier when we don't store derived data in state.
  
- It's OK to break the rules sometimes, as long as you're doing it intentionally, and with confidence.

- As I mentioned in the intro, there are no “best practices”. Deriving state is a good idea 95% of the time, but there are always going to be exceptions! That's why it's important to know why these patterns exist.
