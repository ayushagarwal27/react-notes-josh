# Immer

- One of the cardinal rules in React is that  _state is immutable_. This is true whether we're talking about  `useState`  or  `useReducer`.

- The more complex our state is, the trickier it is to figure out how to make the necessary changes without mutating anything.

- Here's what Immer does in a nutshell: it allows us to write code that _looks_ like it mutates the data. Using some modern JS trickery, however, the data is never actually mutated.
## A working draft

The  `produce`  function we get from Immer takes two arguments:

-   The state we'd like to edit (`currentState`)
    
-   A callback function (`(draftState) => {}`)
    

- `draftState`  is a special “wrapped” version of  `currentState`. Immer will make sure that the original object is never mutated, no matter _what_ we try to do to this wrapped version.

- After running the code in our callback function, `produce` will resolve to a brand-new object, with all of the modifications applied.

- Immer ships with a tool, `current`, which can help "unpack" a proxy, for debugging purposes

- To be clear, you shouldn't ever need to use  `current`  in your final production code. It's a tool that exists purely to help you debug, while you're solving the problem at hand.

- It can be a bit annoying to need to import and apply a function just to see what the current value is, but in my opinion, it's a small price to pay.
