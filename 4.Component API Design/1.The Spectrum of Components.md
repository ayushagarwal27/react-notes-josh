# The Spectrum of Components

- On the left end of this spectrum, we have our generic, low-level, reusable LEGO brick components, things like  `<Button>`  and  `<Modal>`. As we move up the spectrum, we get components like  `<SearchIconButton>`  and  `<LoginForm>`. At the far end, our highest-level component is  `<App>`.

- The further we move along this spectrum, the more and more "tied in" the components get to our application. For  `<LoginForm>`, for example, we need to know quite a bit about our user model: do users use email addresses or usernames to log in?

- Every component should have a clear spot on this spectrum. It should be clear if our component is a low-level LEGO brick, a high-level application-specific view, or something in-between.
- We've now split the responsibilities up into 2 components:
	
	-   `Banner`, a low-level LEGO brick that deals with the UI concerns, showing a banner
	    
	-   `LoggedInBanner`, a mid-level component that checks whether the user is verified, and renders a  `Banner`  if so.
