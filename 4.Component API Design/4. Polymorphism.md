# Polymorphism

- In order to build usable, accessible interfaces, it's important that we understand the semantics of different HTML tags.

- For example: if an element can be clicked to perform an action in JS,  **it should be a button!**  Unless that action is to navigate the user to a new page, in which case, it should be an anchor (`<a>`).

- When choosing an HTML tag, **it's much more important to focus on the  _semantics_  than the  _aesthetics_.** You should use a `<button>` even if you don't want it to _look_ like a button. With CSS, we can strip away all of those built-in button styles. It's much easier to remove a handful of CSS rules than it is to recreate all of the usability benefits built into the `<button>` tag.

- A technique known as _**polymorphism**_. here's what it looks like:
```jsx
function  LinkButton({
 href,
 children,
  ...delegated
})  {
  const  Tag  =  typeof href ===  'string'
  ?  'a'
  :  'button';
  
  return  (
  <Tag
	  href={href}
	  className={styles.button}
	  {...delegated}
   >
	  {children}
  </Tag>
  );
}
```

- The `Tag` variable will resolve either to the string `"a"` or `"button"`. The type is dynamic, but either way, it's a string.

- Why does  `Tag`  have to be uppercase? Wouldn't it be more natural to make our variable  `"tag"`  instead?

- Lowercase JSX tags are treated  _verbatim_, while capitalized JSX tags are treated  _dynamically_:
```jsx
<Button/>  // React.createElement(Button)
<button/>  // React.createElement('button')
```
- We need to use a capital letter so that the JSX compiler creates an element using the  `Tag`  variable, and not the  `"tag"`  string.
