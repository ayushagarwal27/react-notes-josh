# Slots

```jsx
function  CaptionedImage({ image, caption })  {
 return (
	<figure>
		{image}
		<div  className="divider"  />
		<figcaption>{caption}</figcaption>
	</figure>
  );
}

// We'd use it like this:
<CaptionedImage
  image={
	<img
		alt="A punk-rock cat illustration"
		src="https://sandpack-bundler.vercel.app/img/punk-cat.png"
	/>
   }
  caption="Illustration by Josh Comeau"
/>
```
- The  `image`  prop takes a  _React element_. Essentially, it creates a “slot” inside the  `<figure>`  for the consumer to include whatever markup we need.

-  In a way, this isn't a new idea: we've been doing it since Module 1! But, up until now, it's always been through the  `children`  prop.
```jsx
// Using `children` instead of `image`:
<CaptionedImage  caption="Illustration by Josh Comeau">
  <img
  alt="A punk-rock cat illustration"
  src="https://sandpack-bundler.vercel.app/img/punk-cat.png"
  />
</CaptionedImage>
```

- **The  `children`  prop isn't special.**  We can pass React elements to  _any_  prop, not just  `children`!

- The beautiful thing about this pattern is that it allows us to include  _multiple_  slots in a single component. It's like being able to specify multiple distinct children!

- We can use below code for cloning react element - JS object or
- We can pass React component like caption={Icon} and render it in abstracted code

```js 
const newIcon = React.cloneElement(icon, {
      strokeWidth: 1,
    });
```
