# Unstyled Component Libraries

- These libraries are focused purely on the mechanics and usability. Often, accessibility is a first-class concern. They have no built-in design system, and the few styles that are included can easily be overridden.

**Mix and match!**

- Because these libraries are unstyled, you don't need to pick one and stick with it. We can "mix and match" components from multiple libraries!

- **But won't it bloat our JavaScript bundles to depend on multiple component libraries?**  Fortunately not! All of the libraries we're going to talk about here support “tree-shaking”, which means our bundles only include the specific components we  `import`. There might be some small additional cost from mixing components from multiple libraries (eg. if they depend on different lower-level packages), but this has been pretty minimal in my experience.

**Why would we want to mix and match?**  I can think of two good reasons:

1.  We can assemble our own bespoke collection of our favourite components.
    
2.  If the package we choose becomes unmaintained, we can gradually migrate to a newer solution, one component at a time. We don't have to drop everything else and spend weeks moving everything over!

## Radix Primitives

- [Radix Primitives](https://www.radix-ui.com/)  is a library of unstyled, accessible components. It's an incredibly rich library, with a ton of components.

- (In [their docs](https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/primitives/overview/introduction), the components are shown with styles, but those styles aren't actually included with the component library, they're for demonstration purposes only.)

## Headless UI

- [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/)  is another unstyled, accessibility-focused component library.

- It's maintained by the team at Tailwind Labs, and is primarily intended to be used with Tailwind (though this absolutely isn't a hard requirement!).
