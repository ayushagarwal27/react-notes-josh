# The useCallback Hook

- **Here's the short version:**  It solves the same “preserved references” problem as  `useMemo`, but for  _functions_  instead of arrays / objects.

- Similar to arrays and objects, functions are compared by _reference_, not by _value_

Using what we've learned about  `useMemo`, we could solve the problem like this:
```js
const handleMegaBoost =  React.useMemo(()  =>  {
  return  function()  {
     setCount((currentValue)  => currentValue +  1234);
  }
}, []);
```
- Instead of returning an array, we're returning a  _function_. This function is then stored in the  `handleMegaBoost`  variable.

This works… but there's a better way:
```js
const handleMegaBoost =  React.useCallback(()  =>  {
  setCount((currentValue)  => currentValue +  1234);
}, []);
```
- `useCallback`  serves the same purpose as  `useMemo`, but it's built specifically for functions. We hand it a function directly, and it memoizes that function, threading it between renders.

Put another way, these two expressions have the same effect:
```js
// This:
React.useCallback(function  helloWorld(){},  []);

// ...Is functionally equivalent to this:
React.useMemo(()  =>  function  helloWorld(){},  []);
```
- In other words,  `useCallback`  is  syntactic sugar. It exists purely to make our lives a bit nicer when trying to memoize callback functions.
  
- Better to use useCallback on custom hooks, because we never know where all places it is going to be used.
