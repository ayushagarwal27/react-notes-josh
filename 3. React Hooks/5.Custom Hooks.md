# Custom Hooks
- package up react logic and share between react components.

- must start with **"use"**, works without it, but bad convention.

- custom hook useRef pattern can have wither component owning ref or custom hook owning ref.

- common convention in react to pass elements in array than object in custom hooks, so that we can change name of array elements at time of destructuring.
