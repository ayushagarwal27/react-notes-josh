# Side Effects

As we build applications, we often need to synchronize with external systems. This can include things like:

-   Making network requests
    
-   Managing timeouts / intervals
    
-   Reading/writing from localStorage
    
-   Listening for global events
    
Anytime we want to do something outside of react job responsibilities, but still need to be synchronized  with the state we are holding in react, React calls all of these things “side effects”
