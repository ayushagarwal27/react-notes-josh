# Cleanup Function

 - When component is unmounted we remove references to the instance of that component.
 
 - If an event is subscribed to, which are not cleaned up on unmount of component, we might be still referring to component instances on trigerring of that event.
 
 - A well-written effect should have a single primary purpose. In this case, the primary purpose is to flip the machine back on when the user switches it off, after a 500ms timeout. That's why this effect exists. And this is what I want us to focus on.

- **Early returns allow us to emphasize an effect's primary purpose.**  We can  _clear away_  the conditions, so that they don't obfuscate the primary purpose.
- This pattern is useful for all functions, not just React effects! And when we use it consistently, it makes it much easier for us to quickly understand what a function is doing. It's especially beneficial for more-complex functions with multiple conditions.

 - When followed consistently, early returns make it much easier to understand how complex code is structured.
