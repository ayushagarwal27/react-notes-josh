# The useEffect hook

- React gives us a specific tool for managing side effects: the `useEffect` hook. We pass some code to `useEffect`, via a callback function, and React calls that function for us right after each render.

- Though we can call side effects inside render - cycle by calling function inside react component - bad convention

- useEffect hook gives us more control and flexibility on how that effect is managed.

- array of dependencies - state variable on which useEffect depends on,

- effect always runs after every first render.

- , **useEffect fires near-instantaneously.**

As you use React outside this course platform, you might notice something a bit curious: effects seem to run  _twice_  right when the component first mounts.

This is due to a setting known as  _Strict Mode_. In Strict Mode, React will automatically re-run certain chunks of code, while we're working on our applications. This is done to highlight potential issues.

- We can have multiple useEffect inside component, and it is recommended to have as many you need, so each of them only deals with single concern.

- We don't get warning when we use setState fn inside useEffect hook, but using state variables shows warning because setState function do not change overtime, but state variable does. Similar is the case with use of ref variable inside useEffect hook.
