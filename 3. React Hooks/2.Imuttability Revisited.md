# Immutability Revisited

What's the difference between  _snapshots_  and  _instances_?

- As we learned in the  [“Component Instances” lesson](https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/joy-of-react/02-state/09-component-instances), a component instance is a JavaScript object that is the “source of truth” for everything related to a particular instance of a component. It's created when the component is mounted, and it persists until the component is unmounted.

- A snapshot, by contrast, is not a specific JavaScript object. It's a more abstract/metaphorical concept. It refers to the data available at a moment in time.

- So, we might say that an  _instance_  holds the true value of a piece of state, but every time that state  _changes_, we create a snapshot that captures the  _current value_  of that state variable.
