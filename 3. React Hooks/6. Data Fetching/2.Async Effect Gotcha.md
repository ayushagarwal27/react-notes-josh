# Async Effect Gotcha
- When React runs our effect, we hand it a cleanup function. React will invoke this cleanup function when the dependencies change, and when the component unmounts.

Now let's suppose we have some async work to do in this effect:
```js
React.useEffect(async  ()  =>  {
  const intervalId =  window.setInterval(()  =>  {},  1000);
  await  someLongRunningProcess();

  // Even though we're returning a function, it'll actually

  // return a *promise* that resolves to a function:
  return  ()  =>  {
  window.clearInterval(intervalId);
  };
});
```
- When React runs  _this_  effect, it doesn't receive a cleanup function, it receives a promise.

- What happens if the component unmounts while that long-running process is running? React can't do any cleanup, because we haven't yet handed React the cleanup function!

- To avoid sticky situations like this, the React team decided that effect callbacks  _can't_  be async functions. It would open too many cans of worms.

Instead, we can wrap our async logic up in an async function. That way, React receives the cleanup function immediately:
```js
React.useEffect(()  =>  {
  async  function  runEffect()  {
  /* Async stuff */
  }
  
  runEffect();

  // Cleanup function is returned right away:
  return  ()  =>  {
  /* Cleanup stuff */
  };
});
```
