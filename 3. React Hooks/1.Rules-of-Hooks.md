# Rules of Hooks

- Hooks are plain old JavaScript functions.

- When we call these functions, they "hook into" React internals. And we can catch React off-guard. It expects these hook functions to be used in very specific ways, and if we violate those expectations, bad things happen.

There are two “Rules of Hooks” that we should learn, in order to make sure we're always using hooks as React expects.

1.  Hooks have to be called within the scope of a React application. We can't call them outside of our React components.
2.  We have to call our hooks at the **top level of the component.**

- React hooks cannot be called conditionally, or even inside any loops or inside function calls.

- When you really want to use hooks conditionally, we can make another component which uses hooks and do conditional rendering on that component.
