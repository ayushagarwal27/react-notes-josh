# Refs

- useRef gives us `{current: undefined` where we set current to anything we want, for dom nodes we can assign element as ref={refname} attribute.
- React refs are intended to be mutated
- The ref object created by the `useRef` hook should be thought of as a box. We can store whatever we want in this box: DOM nodes, numbers, arrays, objects, functions, etc.

> That said, the _primary_ use case for refs is to store DOM nodes. It's pretty rare for me to need to store anything else in a ref.
